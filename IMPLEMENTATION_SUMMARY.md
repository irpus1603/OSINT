# OSINT Dashboard for Security Company - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) dashboard implementation for a security company. The system monitors security threats by scraping news media and social media sources, performs sentiment analysis, and presents actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap and Chart.js
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: TextBlob library
- **Web Scraping**: feedparser, BeautifulSoup4, Tweepy
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn, Whitenoise

## Core Components

### 1. Scraper Application
- **News Media Scraping**: Collects articles from RSS feeds of major news sources
- **Social Media Scraping**: Collects posts from Twitter/X using API
- **Keyword Filtering**: Applies security-related keywords to filter relevant content
- **Data Storage**: Stores articles and posts with metadata in database

### 2. Analyzer Application
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines positive/negative/neutral sentiment of content
- **Trending Topics**: Identifies and tracks trending security-related topics
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for sentiment analysis

### 3. Scheduler Application
- **Crawling Tasks**: Manages scheduled scraping tasks (hourly/daily/weekly)
- **Task Monitoring**: Tracks execution status and logs
- **Error Handling**: Manages failures and retries

### 4. Dashboard Application
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for insights
- **Filtering**: Time range, source, sentiment, and keyword filters
- **Alerts**: Configurable notifications for critical events
- **Reporting**: Automated and custom report generation

### 5. API Application
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Programmatic access to data
- **Authentication**: Secure API access
- **Pagination**: Efficient data retrieval

## Key Features Implemented

### Data Collection
- Scrapes news from international and Indonesian sources
- Collects social media posts based on security keywords
- Supports multiple content sources (RSS, Twitter API)

### Data Processing
- Keyword-based filtering for security-related content
- Sentiment analysis with confidence scoring
- Data deduplication and normalization

### Scheduling
- Configurable crawl frequencies (hourly/daily/weekly)

- Automatic scheduling of scraping tasks

### Dashboard
- Interactive visualizations (charts, graphs, tables)
- Real-time sentiment analysis display
- Trending topics identification
- Source performance metrics
- Alert management system

## Database Schema

### Scraper Models
- **Source**: News/social media sources with metadata
- **Keyword**: Security-related terms for filtering
- **Article**: News articles with content and metadata
- **Post**: Social media posts with engagement metrics

### Analyzer Models
- **ArticleSentiment**: Sentiment analysis for articles
- **PostSentiment**: Sentiment analysis for social media posts
- **TrendingTopic**: Identified trending security topics

### Scheduler Models
- **CrawlTask**: Scheduled scraping tasks with configuration
- **CrawlLog**: Execution logs for crawling tasks

### Dashboard Models
- **DashboardConfig**: User-specific dashboard preferences
- **Alert**: Configurable notification rules
- **Report**: Generated reports with content

## Deployment Architecture
