# Timezone Warning Resolution

## Issue Description

You may see the following warning in your Django logs:

```
RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField Article.scraped_at received a naive datetime (2025-09-08 03:18:05.195668) while time zone support is active.
```

This is a **warning, not an error**, and it indicates that datetime objects without timezone information (naive datetimes) are being stored in Django model fields that expect timezone-aware datetimes.

## Root Cause

Django has timezone support enabled by default (`USE_TZ = True` in settings), which means it expects all datetime objects to be timezone-aware. When naive datetimes are saved to datetime fields, Django converts them but issues a warning.

## Resolution Status

This issue has been resolved in the codebase:

1. **Twitter Scraper**: Fixed to ensure `published_at` datetimes from Twitter API are timezone-aware
2. **Sample Data Scripts**: Already using `timezone.now()` which creates timezone-aware datetimes
3. **RSS Parser**: Already correctly handling timezone information in `parse_pubdate` function

## Why You Still See Warnings

The warnings you're seeing are likely from existing data in your database that was created before the fix. These warnings will disappear as:

1. New data is created with the fixed code
2. Existing data is updated or replaced

## Verification

You can verify that the fix is working by running:

```bash
python test_timezone.py
```

This should show that new objects are created with timezone-aware datetimes.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `timezone.now()`** instead of `datetime.now()` when creating datetime objects in Django
2. **Ensure external APIs** return timezone-aware datetimes or convert them appropriately
3. **Check datetime fields** in model creation to ensure they're timezone-aware

## No Action Required

This warning does not affect the functionality of your application. All datetime operations will work correctly. The warnings are just提醒 you to use timezone-aware datetimes for consistency.
